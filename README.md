# Email Classification System
A cutting-edge email classification system designed for support teams to categorize emails into Incident, Request, Problem, or Change. Powered by DistilBERT for precise classification and SpaCy + Regex for secure PII masking, it ensures privacy compliance. Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using FastAPI and Docker, this project leverages GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD, showcasing modern DevOps practices.

üåü Key Features

Advanced Classification:
Utilizes DistilBERT for high-accuracy email categorization.
Supports four categories: Incident, Request, Problem, Change.


Secure PII Masking:
Masks sensitive data (emails, names, phone numbers) using SpaCy and Regex.
Non-LLM approach ensures compliance with privacy regulations.


Scalable API:
FastAPI powers a clean /classify POST endpoint.
Delivers structured JSON output for seamless integration.


Production-Ready:
Dockerized for consistent development and deployment environments.
Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for reliable access.


Robust Testing:
Comprehensive unit tests for API, model, and PII masking using pytest.
Ensures system reliability and maintainability.


Automated CI/CD:
GitHub Actions enables rapid, error-free deployments.
Streamlines updates to Hugging Face Spaces.


Code Excellence:
Adheres to PEP8 standards with type hints.
Well-documented with structured logging via Loguru.

Prepare Dataset:

Ensure data/combined_emails_with_natural_pii.csv is available.


Train the Model:
python scripts/train_model.py


Run the API:
uvicorn src.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


Test the API:

Send a POST request to http://localhost:8000/classify:
{
  "email_body": "Subject: Issue\nHello, my name is John Doe, contact me at john@example.com."
}





üê≥ Docker Setup

Build the Image:
docker build -t email-classifier .


Run the Container:
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env email-classifier


Access the API:

Navigate to http://localhost:8000.
